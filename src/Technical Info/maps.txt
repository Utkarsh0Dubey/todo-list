1. **Purpose of `map()`**:
    a. `map()` is a built-in JavaScript array method used to transform each element of an array by applying a provided callback function.
    b. It creates a new array containing the results of the transformation without modifying the original array.

2. **Input of `map()`**:
    a. The method takes two arguments:
        i. An **array** to be processed.
        ii. A **callback function** that is executed for each element of the array.
    b. The **callback function** itself can take three arguments:
        i. **Element**: The current element being processed.
        ii. **Index** (optional): The index of the current element in the array.
        iii. **Array** (optional): The original array being traversed.

3. **Output of `map()`**:
    a. A **new array** containing the results of the callback function applied to each element of the original array.
    b. The new array always has the same length as the original array.

4. **Key Features of `map()`**:
    a. **Immutability**: Does not mutate the original array.
    b. **Functional**: Works in a declarative way by focusing on "what to do" rather than "how to do it."
    c. **Inline Usage**: Can be directly used in JSX, making it ideal for rendering lists of components in React.

5. **Examples**:
    a. Basic Example:
        ```javascript
        const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
        const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
        console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
        ```
    b. Example in React:
        ```jsx
        const tabs = ["Home", "About", "Contact"];
        const tabButtons = tabs.map((tab, index) => (
            <button key={index}>{tab}</button>
        ));
        console.log(tabButtons); 
        // Output: [
        //   <button key="0">Home</button>,
        //   <button key="1">About</button>,
        //   <button key="2">Contact</button>
        // ]
        ```

6. **Comparison with Loops**:
    a. Unlike a `for` loop, `map()` automatically handles array transformation and returns a new array.
    b. Saves boilerplate code by avoiding manual element addition (e.g., no need for `push()`).
    c. Works more declaratively, aligning well with React's design philosophy.
